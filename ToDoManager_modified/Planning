So this project will have following features and for very feature there
will be a module to perform it, Features -

1. Add task
2. Remove task
3. Points - For completing a task - +10 points
        - For skipping the task - -5 points
        - For not completing the task before deadline - -8 points
4. History saving of user on how he is performing
5. Time_Manager - As we will be needing to run the time in background and will
                inform user again and again by opening terminal  and  printing 
                for the information for reminding  the  user. And we will also 
                save and calculate epoch as  if user  turn off the device then 
                later also when he will open it we will be able to remind user.

Miscellaneous Things (Add Task) -

1. We will save the data in json file
2. Only one main json file for all data will be there
3. Json file will store following things - 
        a. Epoch
        b. Tasks
        c. History(Dict) - 
                Points
                Pending tasks
                Undone and skipped tasks
                
4. Json file name would be "data.json"

Miscellaneous Things (Remove Task) -

1. The module will allow user to delete a task
2. Thing to be kept in mind is that whenever this
module will be used some points will be  deducted
or some update will be in it.

# Here discussion on point system will be there
Points system -
    +ve -
        Initializing task = +2
        Completing the task = +8
        total points for one task = +10

    -ve -
        Cancelling a task = -4
        Crossing the deadline = -6
        # More points will be deducted if user crosses
        the deadline as if  user cancels the task then
        he has admitted his mistake but not in deadline.

    No deduct in points -
        If user cancels a task in less then 2 mins then
        no points  will be  deducted but  if it exceeds
        2 mins then the case would be taken as normal &
        4 points would be deducted.

Point Manager -
# The point manager will be used to manage points.
It will take  some arguments and depending on the
argument it will add or deduct points.

    The point manager will take 3 args, one will be for
    how  many  points to  be added or deducted and the
    time will be taken by manager on itself through time
    module. 2nd would be for what purpose was it deducted.

    The 3rd arg would be taken as deadline time and that
    deadline time would be taken from user in form of hours
    or days like for home work I have 3hrs deadline so I'll
    choose the option of hours and will put the task.


Important Note -
    A module would be there for a function which will be called every
    time the  project is started and it will  check the  status  that
    which  task's deadline is crossed whose deadline is near. If  the
    deadline is near then it will warn the user. May this initializer
    would be called many times depending on the situation.

    The name of the module will be "initializer".

Reset module -
A module ahs been made and this will allow user to reset all of his data.

Debugged -
A bug was there, which was causing not to update the points in data
sector and now it is fixed.

Handled exceptions -
Many more exceptions were there which I have handled so there is minimum
chance of any error.
